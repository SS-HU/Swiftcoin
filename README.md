# Swiftcoin
A simplistic blockchain &amp; cryptocurrency in a Swift Playground

![](swiftcoin.png)

Uses [CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift) for hashing. Inspired by [https://anders.com/blockchain/](https://anders.com/blockchain/).

Swiftcoin is not [SwiftCoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwiftCoin). Nor is it available on any of the major cryptocurrency exchanges. The only way to 'get' it, is by donating to [1JzcdWveQiYM4ugoK5mxUNuY2FFxi3h2rH](https://blockchain.info/address/1JzcdWveQiYM4ugoK5mxUNuY2FFxi3h2rH) and file a pull request accordingly :wink:
