Uses [CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift) for hashing.

Swiftcoin is not [SwiftCoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwiftCoin). Nor is it available on any of the major cryptocurrency exchanges. The only way to 'get' it, is by donating to [1JzcdWveQiYM4ugoK5mxUNuY2FFxi3h2rH](https://blockchain.info/address/1JzcdWveQiYM4ugoK5mxUNuY2FFxi3h2rH).
